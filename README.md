# KRNKsite

This is a fork of a previous group project that was intended to be an Arxiv web scraper that could compile a "daily digest" of recommended articles for users based off of their preferences. One of our group members (the one in charge of the scraping) had their standing revoked due to egregious moral failure, and this repo was created to allow us to continue working on the project, albeit without the involvement of the AI/scraping.
